The LMS is chosen to be the topic of the software, named "Whiteboard",                that is going to be developed in this project. The main purpose of this system is to provide a platform                for users to perform learning activities and interact with each other through web-based interface.            </p>            <p>To see the implemented operations up to current iteration, please click the button below.</p>            <p class="btn-toolbar">                <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" href="${subj_list}" role="button">View Subject List</a>                <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" href="${architecture}" role="button">View Architecture Design</a>            </p>        </div>        <div class="row">            <div class="col-lg-4">                <h2>What is LMS?</h2>                <p>                    The Enterprise Learning Management System (LMS) is a software application for the administration,                    documentation, tracking, reporting and delivery of educational courses or training programs                    (Ryann, 2009). One of the famous examples of LMS is "Blackboard Learn" from "Blackboard Inc.",                    which is widely used in many universities.                </p>                <p>                    One of the examples of the use of LMS would be a subject coordinator being able to post                    announcements to the subject page and being able to manage them. Below is the use case                    diagram illustrating this example.                </p>            </div>            <div class="col-lg-8">                <h2>Feature One - Content Management Use Cases</h2>                <p>                    Sharing educational contents is one of the main purposes of LMS, which means being able to store                    different types of data and do CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations on them is essential.                    With according authorizations, a user (e.g. administrator) should be able to create new data of                    different kinds including adding new subjects, adding students to the subject, uploading files,                    posting announcements and many more. The user should also be able to view and/or modify any existing                    contents or decide to remove any if desired.                </p>                <img src="${images}/usecase.png"/>            </div>        </div>    </div> <!-- /container --></jsp:root>
